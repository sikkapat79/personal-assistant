# KISS, DRY & SOLID

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer the simplest solution that works. Avoid unnecessary abstraction, indirection, or cleverness. If in doubt, choose the option that is easier to read and change later.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, authoritative place. Extract repeated logic into a shared function, module, or type; avoid copy-paste. When behaviour must stay in sync in multiple places, centralise it.
- **SOLID**:
  - **S**ingle responsibility: one reason to change per module/class.
  - **O**pen/closed: extend via new code (e.g. new adapters), not by editing existing code.
  - **L**iskov substitution: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
  - **I**nterface segregation: small, focused interfaces (e.g. ports) over one big interface.
  - **D**ependency inversion: depend on abstractions (ports/interfaces), not concrete adapters; composition wires implementations.
